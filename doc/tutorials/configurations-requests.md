The _Devo Applications Builder_ allows queries to any source.
However, generally the queries are made directly to data stored our platform.
These queries are made through the Devo
[Query API](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/ndt/latest/api-reference/query-api/running-queries-with-the-query-api).

In applications, the queries are defined in the `src/resources/requests.js`
file.

## Devo Query API requests

The queries using the API are expresseds in LINQ.
If you need to know more information about
[how build a query using LINQ language](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/ndt/latest/searching-data/building-a-query/build-a-query-using-linq),
go to our public documentation.
The authentication of the applications with the Query API is delegated to
_Devo Applications Data Library_, you will not have to worry about it.

A simple query will look like the following:

```
from demo.ecommerce.data select *
```

### The Request class

The [Request](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library/blob/master/doc/request/Request.md) class is the main one to create a request in
_Devo Applications Builder_.
However, in applications it is common to use other classes, which inherit from
this one, to make requests.

### Simple query request

To create a simple request, we must create an instance of class _RequestApi_.
Visit the [Devo Applications Data Library](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library) documentation for more
information.

```javascript
import RequestApi from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestApi';
import dateRange from '@devo/applications-builder/utils/dateRange';
..

let request = new RequestApi({
  query: 'from demo.ecommerce.data select *',
  dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day'),
});
```

Method [_dateRange_](module-dateRange.html) is a _Devo Applications Builder_
utility for managing dates.

However, you can use custom dates for a query.
You just have to declare an object with the _from_ and the _to_ timestamp
values of the date period you want to make the request.

```javascript
import RequestApi from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestApi';
import dateRange from '@devo/applications-builder/utils/dateRange';
..

let request = new RequestApi({
  query: 'from demo.ecommerce.data select *',
  dates: {
    from: moment('01/01/2020').valueOf(),
    to: moment('02/01/2020').valueOf()
    },
});
```

### Simulate query request

Sometimes you can simulate a request for testing purposes and simultae a
normal request.
Instead of request to the API, you need to load a JSON object locally.

To simulate a request, use the [RequestApiMock](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library/blob/master/doc/request/RequestApiMock.md) class.

```javascript
import RequestApiMock from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestApiMock';

let data = {
  m: {
    eventdate: { type: 'timestamp', index: 0 },
    count: { type: 'int8', index: 1 },
  },
  d: [
    [1551916800000, 21520],
    [1552003200000, 551753],
    [1552089600000, 552003],
    [1552176000000, 551988],
    [1552262400000, 551497],
    [1552348800000, 551307],
    [1552435200000, 551290],
    [1552521600000, 551193],
    [1552608000000, 551580],
  ],
};

let request = new RequestApiMock({
  results: data,
  delay: 1000,
});
```

### Queries request in sequence

Sometimes you will need a widget to display the data resulting from a series
of requests and operations.
The [RequestChain](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library/blob/master/doc/request/RequestChain.md) class allows these types of requests to be made.

The _RequestChain_ receives an array of a mix of functions and Request object
that will be executed sequenctially.

```javascript
import RequestApi from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestApi';
import RequestChain from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestChain';
import dateRange from '@devo/applications-builder/utils/dateRange';
..

let request = new RequestChain([
  new RequestApi({
    template: `from demo.ecommerce.data
               group by method
               select count() as count`,
    dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day')
  }),
  (data) => {
    return {
      methods:
        JSON.stringify(Array.from(new Set(data.object.map(i => i.method))))
    };
  },
  new RequestApi({
    template: `from siem.logtrust.web.activity
               where method in {{methods}}
               group by hostname
               select count() as count`,
    dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day')
  }),
]);
```

> Each query on Request object should be declarated as a `template`.

### Request cache

By default, the request has a mechanism for buffering the result data.
This prevents to call the request twice with the same parameters.

If the application does not need this functionallity (in case of too much
memory taken or if the result of the query changes even if the same params
are used) you can disable this behaviour:

```javascript
requests.add(
  'requestKey',
  new RequestApi({
    query: 'from demo.ecommerce.data select *',
    dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day'),
    cache: false,
  })
);
```

### Queries templates

Sometimes a query needs to change over the time, but only in some fields.
For example, make a query that depends on a selector with the names of the
methods.

```
from demo.ecommerce.data where method="{{selectedMethod}}"
```

In the query, _selectedMethod_ is a value that can be changed by the user.
The request object should be like the following code:

```javascript
let request = new RequestApi({
  template: 'from demo.ecommerce.data where method="{{selectedMethod}}',
  dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day'),
});
```

> Pay attention to the change of _query_ by _template_.

Then, in the widget you will need indicate to use the template.

```javascript
widget.setRequests(requests.get('requestID').parseTemplate({ selectedMethod: 'GET' });
```

### Requests singleton

To reuse the requests between code of the application, _Devo Applications Data Library_ use a _Singleton_ pattern from _Devo Applications Builder_.

So, in the `src/resources/requests.js` file each request must be added to the [Requests](Requests.html) class.

```javascript
import requests from '@devo/applications-builder/data/requests';
import RequestApi from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestApi';
import dateRange from '@devo/applications-builder/utils/dateRange';

requests.add(
  'requestKey',
  new RequestApi({
    query: 'from siem.logtrust.web.activity select *',
    dates: dateRange.fromNow(1, 'day'),
  })
);
```

Then, you can use it in the widgets or in any other part of the application.

```javascript
import requests from "@devo/applications-builder/data/requests";

...

widget.setRequests([requests.get("requestKey")]);
```

### Launch the query in the Data Search

The application queries can be launched in the Data Search.
This option is available in each widget, in the menu on the right side.

<img src="application/data-search.png" alt="Go to query" />

However, not all queries are supported.
So, in this case the owner of the application should adapt the request for this option.

See the documentation [here](module-dataSearch.html).

## Query to an external API

You can query data from an external resource.
The [RequestCustom](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library/blob/master/doc/request/RequestApiCustom.md) class wraps a custom call into the framework lifecycle.

In this case you will need to create a function that adapts the data to the data structure supported by _Devo Applications Data Library_.

```javascript
import RequestApi from '@devo/applications-data-library/requests/RequestCustom';

function apiCall(cb) {
  $.ajax({
    url: 'https://somebigdataplatformnotascoolasdevo/api/resource',
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
      token: '1234567890SuperSecure',
    },
    success: cb,
  });
}

let request = new RequestCustom({
  callFn: apiCall,
});
```

By default, widgets expect data to come in the following format:

```json
  {
    "m": {
      "field1": {"type":"timestamp","index":0},
      "field2":{"type":"int8","index":1}
      ...
    },
    "d":[
      [valueField1, valueField2],
      [valueField1, valueField2],
      [valueField1, valueField2],
      [valueField1, valueField2],
      ...
    ]
  }
```
