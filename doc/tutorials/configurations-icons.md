Applications can use icons, both in the graphics themselves and in the
headers of widgets, sections and tabs.

In the graphics, it is enough to pass the icon identifier to it.
In the rest of the application they can be used inside a `<i>` element.

```javascript
<i class="lticon-polaroid_picture_image_photo"></i>
```

The list of available icons can be found
