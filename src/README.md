# Devo Applications Builder

The applications in Devo are a set of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript functions
that are saved independently from the web to allow for dynamism when creating and
editing the applications.

_Devo Application Builder_ are a set of widgets with extended functionality.
When an [_activeboard_](https://docs.devo.com/confluence/ndt/latest/activeboards)
doesn't meet the required needs, the idea is to use this library to solve the issue.

The documentation is structured in the following way:

- You can read the official documentation at [main documentation web](https://devoinc.github.io/applications-builder)
- You can read the `src/README.md` file and go through the code to see how it
  works. All classes and methods are self-documented.
- In the [doc](./doc/index.md) folder there are more examples and documentation.
  Note that these are the same as the ones in the main documentation page.

This library uses [Devo Applications Data Library](https://github.com/DevoInc/applications-data-library).
This package is contained and installed from the `deps` folder.
